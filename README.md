# Ben - SOC Analyst / Cyber Security Portfolio

## Overview

I am an aspiring **SOC Analyst** with a strong focus on **practical security operations, incident detection, and investigative workflows**.  
My work centers around **realistic environments, hands-on labs, and end-to-end security monitoring**, rather than theoretical knowledge alone.

This portfolio documents my progression through **SIEM tooling, threat detection, log analysis, and incident response**, with an emphasis on how decisions are made inside a live SOC.

## Portfolio Projects

### 1. GeoIP Abuse Mapping & Open VM Honeypot
**Objective:**  
Simulate a publicly exposed asset and analyze real-world attack traffic.

**What This Demonstrates:**
- Azure VM exposure & telemetry collection  
- Ingesting Windows Security Events into Sentinel  
- Mapping malicious IP addresses by geography  
- Identifying attack patterns via Event IDs  
- Writing KQL queries to isolate abuse signals  

**Key Skills Shown:**
- Threat visibility  
- Log interpretation  
- Practical SIEM usage  
- Documentation & reporting  

---

### 2. SIEM Detection & Investigation Queries
**Objective:**  
Develop and document KQL queries used during SOC triage and investigation.

**What This Demonstrates:**
- Identifying suspicious authentication activity  
- Detecting brute force & failed login patterns  
- Highlighting privilege escalation indicators  
- Separating signal from noise in large datasets  

**Key Skills Shown:**
- Analytical thinking  
- Query construction  
- SOC-style investigative flow  

---

## Certifications & Study

- CompTIA Security+ SY0-701
- Splunk Core Certified Power User
- SC-200 Microsoft Certified: Security Operations Analyst Associate
- Continuous hands-on practice alongside certification study  
- Focus on **understanding alerts**, not memorizing answers  
- Undergoing study for AZ-104, with AZ-500 in mind, and learning key cloud concepts with Learntocloud.guide

## How I Approach Security

I treat cybersecurity as a **systems problem** - technical, human, and procedural.

Rather than chasing tools, I focus on:
- Why an alert exists  
- What normal behavior looks like  
- How attackers move through systems  
- When to escalate vs investigate further  

This portfolio reflects that mindset: **signal over noise, clarity over complexity**.

---

## What I’m Working Toward

- Entry-level **SOC Analyst** role  
- Remote or hybrid environments  
- Teams that value curiosity, documentation, and growth  

I am particularly interested in roles that allow:
- Exposure to real alerts  
- Strong investigation fundamentals  
- Progression into detection engineering or threat hunting
